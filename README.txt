This class is used to create an image to be included in an online form that shows a
simple math test the visitor must solve when submitting the form. The operands and
operation are stored in the $_SESSION data for the page. After submitting the form,
the visitor's answer is checked by calling the verify() method to compare their entry
vs. the session data. If an error is found, the form submission should be rejected.
